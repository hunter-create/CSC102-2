For this assignment, I added a logical error on line 6 by changing the code so that die2 could never roll a 6, no matter how many times the game was played. The tool I used to help debug my code was Google Gemini and asked it to identify the logical error hidden in the code. It immediately found the mistake and also pointed out another issue. Not a logical error, but an error in the rules of the game of Craps, which I had accidentally gotten wrong and left in my code along with the logical error just to show.
